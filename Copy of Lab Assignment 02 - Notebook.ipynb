It is important to understand that these are **unsupervised** methods -- our Python program will learn to identify similar documents and terms on its own without being provided with any guidance about how well it is performing. These techniques can be very useful for identifying latent similarities and differences among a large collection of documents, and for automatically classifying those documents into groups based on how similar they are to each other.\n","\n","###Learning Objectives\n","By the time you finish this lab assignment, you will know:\n","1. How to load data from a comma-separated values (CSV) file into a Pandas dataframe.\n","2. How to improve our text cleaning algorithm so that it can handle acronyms.\n","3.

photometric calibration involves a zero point that varies over the image by up to magnitudes to make a required illumination correction instrumental magnitude is defined in various ways and so when working with instrumental magnitudes it is important to know how they are defined the most basic definition of instrumental magnitude m displaystyle m is given by m log f displaystyle m log f where f displaystyle f is the intensity of the source object in known physical units for example in the paper by mighell it was assumed that the data are in units of electron number generated within pixels of a charge coupled device the physical units of the source intensity are thus part of the definition required for any instrumental magnitudes that are employed the factor of in the above formula originates from the established fact that the human eye can only clearly distinguish the brightness of two objects if one is at least approximately times brighter than the other the instrumental magnitude is defined such that two objects with a brightness ratio of exactly will differ by precisely magnitudes and this is based on pogson s system of defining each successive magnitude as being fainter by displaystyle we can now relate this to the base logarithmic function and the leading coefficient in the above formula displaystyle cdots the approximate value of is used as a convenience its negative sign assures that brighter objects will have smaller and possibly negative values and tabulated values of base logarithms were available more than three centuries before the advent of

of the electromagnetic spectrum with characteristics indicating that the luminosity is not produced by stars a galaxy hosting an AGN is called an active galaxy albedo a measure of the proportion of the total solar radiation received by an astronomical body such as a planet that is diffusely reflected away from the body it is a dimensionless quantity typically measured on a scale from indicating

of luminosity that could not be resolved into their individual components such as star clusters and galaxies neutrino neutron star a type of compact star that is composed almost entirely of neutrons which are a type of subatomic particle with no electrical charge typically neutron stars have a mass between about and times the mass of the sun but with a radius of only km mi making them among the densest known objects in the universe new general catalogue NGC night sky the appearance of the earth s sky at nighttime when the sun is below the horizon and more specifically when clear weather and low levels of ambient light permit visibility of celestial objects such as stars planets and the moon the night sky remains a fundamental setting for both amateur and professional observational

variations nutation is distinguished from precession which is a similar but longer term change in axial orientation o OB association a group of massive stars which are not gravitationally bound to each other but move together through space in a loose association the OB in the name is a reference to stars of stellar classifications o and b obliquity see axial tilt observable universe observational astronomy the practice and study of directly observing astronomical objects with the use of telescopes and other astronomical instruments it is concerned with recording data about the observable universe as opposed to theoretical astronomy which is concerned with calculating the measurable implications of astronomical models occultation a celestial event that occurs when a distant astronomical body or object is hidden by another nearer body or object that passes between it and the observer thereby blocking the first object from view solar and lunar eclipses are specific types of occultations oort cloud also called the öpik oort cloud a vast theoretical cloud of predominantly icy planetesimals hypothesized to surround the sun at distances ranging from to AU it is thought to be divided into two regions a disc shaped inner oort cloud and a spherical outer oort cloud the outer limit of the oort cloud is often considered the cosmographical boundary of the solar system

bound group of up to one thousand stars that formed together in the same molecular cloud opposition the positioning of two celestial objects on opposite sides of the sky from the perspective of an observer this occurs for example when a planet makes its closest approach to the earth placing it in opposition to the sun orbit the gravitationally curved trajectory of an object such as the trajectory of a planet around a star or a natural satellite around a planet though the smaller body is often said to orbit the larger body itself both bodies actually follow approximately elliptical orbits around a common center of mass positioned at a focal point of each ellipse the word orbit can variously refer to the elliptical trajectory itself or the act of following this trajectory and can refer to a stable regularly repeating trajectory as well as a non repeating trajectory orbit plot also called orbital plot a schematic diagram of a complete orbit for a binary system it is typically presented from the primary s frame of reference orbital eccentricity a parameter that determines how much an orbit deviates from a perfect circle for an elliptical orbit the eccentricity ranges from greater than zero to less than one orbital elements the set of parameters that uniquely define an orbit orbital inclination the tilt of an object s orbit around an astronomical body expressed as the angle between the orbital plane or axis of direction of the orbiting object and a plane of reference orbital mechanics orbital node one of two points at which the plane of an orbit intersects a specified plane of reference to which it is inclined in some contexts the two nodes may be distinguished as the ascending node and the descending node a non inclined orbit which is coplanar with the reference plane has no nodes orbital period the time a given astronomical object takes to complete one orbit around another object for objects in the solar system the orbital period is often referred to as the sidereal period orbital plane the imaginary geometric plane defined by the orbit of an astronomical body around its primary the earth s orbital plane which defines the ecliptic is commonly used as a plane of reference for the orbits of other objects in the solar system orbital resonance orbital speed the speed at which an astronomical body or object orbits around a barycenter or its speed relative to the center of mass of the most massive body in the system the term may be used to refer to either the mean orbital speed i e the average speed over the entire orbital period or the

defined as the distance at which a star would show a parallax shift of exactly one arcsecond as observed from earth s orbit it is equal to light years or astronomical units the word parsec is a portmanteau of the words parallax and second partial solar eclipse periapsis also called the pericenter the point at which an orbiting body is closest to its primary contrast apoapsis perigee the point at which a body orbiting the earth such as the moon or an artificial satellite is closest to the earth contrast apogee perihelion the point at which a body orbiting the earth s sun is closest to the sun contrast aphelion perturbation the complex motion of an astronomical body that is subject to forces other than the gravitational attraction of its primary alone or any force which complicates the orbital characteristics of the body such that the idealized kepler orbit of the two body problem is not an accurate representation of the body s actual orbit perturbing forces may include the gravitational forces exerted by any number of additional bodies the off center gravitational forces which are consequences of bodies not being perfectly spherical and or atmospheric resistance phase angle the elongation or angle between an orbiting body and the sun as viewed from a particular perspective such as the earth it determines the amount of a planet or moon s visible surface that lies in

orbital period equal to the average rotational period of the primary and in the same direction as the primary s rotation synodic day the time it takes for an object to rotate once about its own axis e g its rotation period relative to the primary it is orbiting rather than to distant fixed stars the synodic day may be described as the time between two consecutive sunrises in the case where the primary is a star which is not necessarily the same as the sidereal day an object s synodic day may change slightly in duration over the course of the orbital period due to eccentricity and axial tilt for earth the synodic day is often called a solar day synodic period the time it takes for a body visible from another body often the earth to complete a cycle with respect to the background stars visible in the second body s celestial sphere synodic period is most commonly used to indicate the elapsed time between a given body s consecutive appearances in the same location in the night sky as

thick disk population and halo stars tidal braking also called tidal acceleration the transfer of momentum between an astronomical body and an orbiting satellite as the result of tidal forces this can cause changes in the rotation periods for both bodies as well as modification of their mutual orbit a satellite in a prograde orbit will gradually recede from its primary while slowing the rotation rate of both bodies tidal force tidal locking the net result of continued tidal braking such that over the course of an orbit there is no net transfer of angular momentum between an astronomical body and its gravitational partner when the orbital eccentricity is low the result is that the satellite orbits with the same face always pointed toward its primary an example is the moon which is tidally locked with the earth tidal stream a stream of stars and gases which are stripped from gas clouds and star clusters because of interaction with the gravitational field of a galaxy such as the milky way tilt erosion the gradual reduction of the obliquity of an orbiting satellite due to tidal interactions total solar eclipse trans neptunian object TNO transit an astronomical event during which a body or object passes visibly across the face of a much larger body an example is the transit of venus across the face of the sun which was visible from earth in and because a transit results in a

also called the local supercluster LSC or LC w weak line star a reference to the faintness of the spectral lines for a star compared to standard stars with the same stellar classification since most absorption lines are caused by elements other than hydrogen and helium what astronomers refer to as metals these are sometimes called metal weak stars white dwarf a type of stellar remnant composed mostly of electron degenerate matter a white dwarf lacks the mass needed to continue the nuclear fusion process with its constituent atoms so the object s energy output normally comes from radiative

three major clusters of articles in the corpus. How do we know? Well, a heuristic method of identifying the optimal number of clusters is to find the maximum vertical height of a rectangle that is overlayed across the entire dendrogram, with the constraint that the rectangle cannot \"touch\" any of the horizontal lines on the dendrogram. This rectangle is shown in light red in the image below. The optimal number of clusters, then, is the number of vertical lines that pass through the rectangle. In this case, three vertical lines pass through the rectangle (numbered *1.*, *2.*, and *3.*), suggesting that the optimal number of clusters is

dozen new restaurants new artwork and the airport s first moving sidewalks residents of the surrounding area filed lawsuits against the port in the early s complaining of noise vibration smoke and other problems the port and the government of king county adopted the sea tac communities plan in to address problems and guide future development the port spent more than million over the next decade to buy homes and school buildings in the vicinity and soundproof others nearby in the mid s the airport participated in the airport noise compatibility program initiated by congress in airport noise contours were developed real estate was purchased and some homes were retrofitted to achieve noise mitigation in the US ended airline regulation and US airlines were allowed to determine routes and fares without government approval deregulation resulted in new service to seattle including from TWA then the fourth largest US airline as well as delta national and american after the death of US senator henry martin scoop jackson in the seattle port commission voted to change the airport s name to the henry m jackson international airport citizens of tacoma interpreted the change as an insult to their community the second time in the airport s history that the port authorities had attempted to remove tacoma from the name the tacoma had provided for the airport s construction during world war II had come with an explicit promise that the city would be included in the airport s name an additional complicating factor was the existence of another jackson international airport now jackson medgar wiley evers international airport in jackson mississippi whose management threatened legal action to preserve its exclusive use of the name the controversy was resolved after polls of seattle and tacoma area residents showed their preference for the original name by margins as much as helen jackson the widow of the late senator henry m jackson expressed her desire that their family remain neutral in the debate with a vote of the port of seattle commission the name reverted to sea tac in early in the late s the port of seattle and a council representing local county governments considered the future of air traffic in the region and predicted that the airport could reach capacity by in the planning committee concluded that the best solution was to add a third runway to the airport and construct a supplemental two runway airport in one of the neighboring counties members of the community opposed a third runway as did the highline school district and the cities of des moines burien federal way tukwila and normandy park but a study concluded there were no feasible sites for an additional airport the port of seattle approved a plan for the new runway in prompting a lawsuit from opponents the port secured the necessary permits by agreeing to noise reduction programs and environmental protections runway opponents appealed these permits but dropped their challenges in recent years the airport s central terminal building was renovated and expanded in in a project designed by curtis w fentress of fentress architects the third runway opened on november with a construction cost of billion parallel to the existing two the new runway is ft west of runway r allowing landings on both in times of low visibility the older runways are ft apart too close to allow use of both in low visibility in delta air lines announced plans to expand seattle into a transpacific hub since then delta has added numerous international flights and dozens of domestic flights to feed those services delta s increased presence in seattle has been seen by some industry analysts as a response to united airlines transpacific hub at san francisco as well as delta s disenchantment with its former tokyo narita hub delta s expansion at seattle tacoma has created some controversy many of the new domestic services delta started offering from seattle to boost traffic to international flights encroached on routes that alaska airlines previously a long time partner of delta has historically operated delta is seeking a total of gates nearly triple its current gates to accommodate its planned growth future sea tac airport has seen record growth in passenger traffic over the last few years that growth has been partly fueled by the nationwide expansion of seattle based alaska airlines and by delta air lines setting up a major international hub at sea tac airport that growth has strained the airport s facilities and led the port to invest more than billion into several expansion and renovation projects sea tac airport has six outbound baggage handling systems with limited to no cross connectivity the system now in place is aging and reaching its maximum capacity this million project will create one unified high speed baggage system under the airport that will allow bags to be checked from any ticketing counter to receive security screening faster and to be routed to any gate in the airport the extra efficiency and speed will allow the airport to handle more baggage in the future without expanding the footprint of the baggage handling systems the initial phase of the project was finished in and the entire system will be in place by the north satellite terminal has only received limited upgrades since it was opened in and is in need of modernization the port of seattle initially looked at simply updating the terminal in a project it called the north satellite renovation plan northstar in it was announced the port would also significantly expand the terminal the million project now called the north satellite modernization will increase the size of the north satellite by square feet and another eight gates bringing the total to the project s first phase dedicated on july expanded the terminal to the west by feet m and added eight gates a mezzanine level with eateries and a rooftop lounge for alaska airlines the second phase scheduled to be complete by will modernize the remaining areas of the old terminal and expand dining and retail space around the twenty existing gates the international arrivals facility IAF is in the basement of the south satellite it is known to have become severely overcrowded at peak arrival times additionally the process for passengers is complicated by the terminal s isolated location to address the situation the port of seattle is building a new square foot IAF east of concourse a in the main terminal building the facility will increase capacity by nearly percent by increasing the number of passport check booths and kiosks from to and the number of baggage claim carousels from four to seven the new IAF will be connected to the south satellite by a foot long bridge aerial walkway that will take passengers feet above the existing airplane taxiway and over the top of concourse a the project was initially expected to be completed by at a cost of million in late the cost was re calculated to million after the new IAF opens the south satellite will continue to be used for arriving international flights additional international gates will be added in concourse a nearly doubling the number of gates capable of serving larger wide body aircraft once the new international arrivals facility is complete the port of seattle will renovate the south satellite terminal with estimates that the puget sound region will grow by another one million people by the port of seattle began developing the sustainable airport master plan SAMP in to meet passenger and cargo demands the SAMP recommends more than projects to improve efficiency and airport access including a new terminal with gates and an automated people mover through three separate stations according to alaska airlines the airport s largest carrier the facility s plan for a gate terminal would transform sea tac into one of the most congested hubs in the united states as a result of the new terminal being disconnected from the existing terminal passengers moving between terminals would be required travel to reach the other terminal as well as go through separate security screenings in each terminal according to the port s timeline the final national environmental policy act and washington state policy act analyses will be completed by winter facilities terminal seattle tacoma has gates on four concourses and two satellite buildings the two satellite terminal buildings named the north and south satellite are connected to the four concourses in the main terminal by a three line automated people mover system called the satellite transit system the underground system moves passengers quickly within the four concourses of the central terminal and out to

the space needle by elevators that travel at mph km h completing the ascent in seconds they are slowed to mph km h on windy days on april the city s landmarks preservation board designated the tower a historic landmark architecture the architecture of the space needle is the result of a compromise between the designs of two men edward e carlson and john graham jr the two leading ideas for the world fair involved businessman edward e carlson s sketch of a giant balloon tethered to the ground the gently sloping base and architect john graham s concept of a flying saucer the halo that houses the restaurant and observation deck victor steinbrueck introduced the hourglass profile of the tower the space needle was built to withstand wind speeds of mph km h double the requirements in the building code of the mw nisqually earthquake jolted the needle enough in for water to slosh out of the toilets in the restrooms the space needle will not sustain serious structural damage during earthquakes of

on december a powerful beam of light was unveiled for the first time called the legacy light or skybeam it is powered by lamps that total million candela shining skyward from the top of the space needle to honor national holidays and special occasions in seattle the concept of this beam was derived from the official world s fair poster which depicted such a light source although none was incorporated into the original design it is somewhat controversial because of the light pollution it creates originally planned to be turned on nights per year it has generally been used fewer than a dozen times per year it did remain lit for eleven days in a row from september to september in response to the september attacks a seattle world s fair poster showed a grand spiral entryway leading to the elevator that was ultimately omitted from final building plans the stairway was eventually added as part of the pavilion and spacebase remodel in june the main stairwell has steps from the basement to the top of the observation deck at approximately ft m the space needle was the tallest building west of the mississippi river at the time it was built by howard s wright construction co but is now dwarfed by other structures along the seattle skyline among them the columbia center at ft m unlike many other similar structures such as the CN tower in toronto the space needle is not used for broadcasting purposes history construction edward f carlson chairman of the world s fair in seattle had an idea for erecting a tower with a restaurant at the world s fair carlson was president of a hotel company and was not recognized in art or design but he was inspired by a recent visit to the stuttgart tower of germany local architect john graham soon became involved as a result of his success in designing northgate mall graham s first move was to alter the restaurant s original design to a revolving restaurant similar to his previous design of the la ronde tower restaurant at the ala moana shopping center in hawaii the proposed space needle had no pre selected site since it was not financed by the city land had to be purchased within the fairgrounds the investors had been unable to find suitable land and the search for a site was nearly dead when in they discovered a lot by ft by m containing switching equipment for the fire and police alarm systems the land sold for at this point only one year remained before the world s fair would begin the needle was privately financed and built by the pentagram corporation consisting of bagley wright contractor howard s wright architect john graham ned skinner and norton clapp in bagley skinner and clapp sold their interest to howard wright who now controls it under the name of space needle

relations in the hotel industry that was passed by popular vote on november the initiative was placed on the ballot by UNITE HERE local a union that represents workers in the hospitality industry supporters of the measure see it as bringing a measure of justice to exploited workers opponents say the new law is unfair to guests too expensive to implement and unfairly advantages unions legislative history initiative measure was sponsored by UNITE HERE local stefan moritz a union official filed the initial text of the initiative with seattle s city clerk on april the union began collecting signatures to get the measure on the november ballot in may the final text of the initiative was filed on may the union submitted its petition signatures on june and king county elections issued a letter of sufficiency on july the final text of the ballot title was issued on july the measure passed on november and became a city ordinance with full effect on november after a proclamation by mayor ed murray provisions the initiative requires hotels with or more rooms to issue panic buttons to employees that work alone in guest rooms hotels are required to keep lists of guests accused of assault or harassment for five years from the date of the last accusation involving any given guest all relevant documents must be retained for the same period any guest accused of assault sexual assault or sexual harassment must be banned from the hotel for a minimum of three years a mere accusation is sufficient to require a ban no investigation is required there is no provision for appeals workers must be given paid time to make a police report and be given the option to work in a different area of the hotel police may only be contacted with the permission of the worker hotels are required to warn guests about these rules with a placard written in a large font placed on the interior side of their room doors under the initiative when a hotel is sold the new owners are required to offer employees of the previous owner work before hiring replacement staff this requirement applies from the day of sale until six months after the hotel is open to the public while under the management of the new employer if during the first days of operations the new owner finds that it needs fewer workers staff must be retained by order of seniority during this day period staff may not be otherwise dismissed except for cause workers must be provided with a written performance evaluation at the end of this period these records must be retained for at least three years conspicuous public notice of change of ownership including contact information for the new owners must be posted within five days after a sale is agreed to and must remain posted for six months after the hotel has been open to the public under new management this provision applies to hotels with rooms or more the initiative requires large hotels to limit the workload of cleaning staff to square feet per eight hour shift and regulates the handling of cleaning chemicals cleaners assigned space over this limit would be paid at time and a half wage this provision applies to hotels with rooms or more the initiative requires large hotels that don t offer health benefits to pay staff a monthly stipend to help them buy insurance qualifying workers would receive an amount based on their income family size the federal poverty line and the lowest premium offered on the washington health benefits exchange for a gold level policy this provision applies to hotels with or more rooms workers can enforce these rights by filing a complaint with the city of seattle or filing suit in king county superior court penalties issued against hotels go to the complainant affected workers and the city office of civil rights the measure prohibits employer retaliation for exercising any of these rights the law has a rebuttable presumption that any adverse action taken against an employee within days of exercising any of these rights is an act of illegal retaliation union shop exemption except for the provisions relating to assault sexual assault and sexual harassment every part of this measure can be waived in a union shop through collective bargaining debate opposition the seattle times editorial board opposed the initiative they wrote if the safety of seattle hotel employees is a problem the laws that protect them should be strengthened seattle ballot initiative is a sloppy possibly illegal first draft that should be rejected by voters support seattle weekly endorsed the initiative they wrote critics of the initiative largely hotel industry representatives call the measure s stipulations overreaching and draconian they say many hotels already have these kinds of protections in place they also point to i s union exemption clause if workers belong to a union their hotel will not be subject to some of the measure s stipulations to allow for freer collective bargaining we ourselves recognize that the union exemption may be faintly disguised self interest employers might find the law onerous leading them to encourage unionization in hopes of a better deal but if the byproduct of passing i is a stronger local union so be it we believe the result is a step toward justice for a long exploited class of workers union backed or no litigation the american hotel lodging association its washington state chapter and its seattle chapter all filed suit in washington state court to block initiative measure in december their complaint says the potential for mistakes and abuse is significant especially because the hotels are allowed no opportunity to determine whether there was actually any wrongdoing and guests are allowed no opportunity to refute the allegations the blacklist provision requires hotels to punish people by placing them on a list and denying some of them accommodations without any opportunity to investigate the allegations the suit also claimed that the initiative violated the single subject rule written into the seattle city charter the complaint says neither the ballot title nor the concise statement express the multiple subjects of initiative i particularly those which deal with compensation and fringe benefits legal standards for discrimination claims and the novel and disturbing requirement that hotels deny accommodation to certain guests without notice or a chance to respond to allegations on december a washington state court of appeals threw out i in its entirety holding that it unconstitutionally contains multiple unrelated topics after a king county superior court ruled in favor of the initiative the state supreme court last january declined to hear a direct appeal and sent it to the court of appeals for further review the appeals court found that i contains multiple separate parts including protecting workers who must enter guests hotel rooms from sexual harassment and assault by providing panic buttons and requiring hotels to maintain a list of guests who have been accused of sexual assault or harassment requiring hotel employers to provide and use safety devices and safeguards and prohibiting large hotels from requiring hotel workers to clean more than square feet per hour day without time and a half pay requiring large hotel employers to provide healthcare subsidies to hotel workers or the equivalent of a gold level healthcare policy when a hotel changes ownership requiring the new owner to hire from the list of employees prior to the sale for the first six months the statement for and against initiative is here see also hands off pants on references\n","cluster 0: the utilities of seattle are provided by two government owned and five privately owned

bukhori is based on classical persian with a large number of hebrew loanwords as well as smaller numbers of loanwords from other surrounding languages including uzbek and russian the vocabulary includes lexical items of persian arabic uzbek and hebrew origin in the total number of speakers was in the USSR there were speakers in israel there were and in all other countries combined there were ethnic tajik minorities exist in many countries such as afghanistan pakistan and uzbekistan samarkand and bukhara are two cities in uzbekistan which are particularly densely populated by tajik speakers among whom were tens of thousands of bukharan jews in the th to th centuries in modern times the dialects spoken by the few remaining jews in these cities barely differ if at all from their non jewish counterparts today the language is spoken by approximately jews remaining in uzbekistan and surrounding areas although most of its speakers reside elsewhere predominantly in israel approximately speakers and the united states like most jewish languages bukhori traditionally used the hebrew alphabet but throughout the past century due to soviet influence bukhori has been written in latin in the s then cyrillic from onwards the hebrew alphabet fell further into disuse outside of hebrew liturgy when the bukharian jewish schools were closed in central asia and bukharian jewish publications such as books and newspapers began to appear using the cyrillic alphabet today many older bukharian jews who speak bukharian only know the cyrillic alphabet when reading and writing bukharian the origin of its respective spelling system is talmudic orthography during the soviet period communists wanted hebrew to be the language of culture and instruction in the republic of

hellenistic and roman times between the th century BC and the th century AD following the seljuk invasion of asia minor during the th century AD pontus became isolated from many of the regions of the byzantine empire the pontians remained somewhat isolated from the mainland greeks causing pontic greek to develop separately and distinctly from the rest of the mainland greek however the language has also been influenced by the nearby persian caucasian and turkish languages dialects greek linguist manolis triantafyllidis has divided the pontic of turkey into two groups the western group oinountiac or niotika around oenoe turkish ünye the eastern group which is again subdivided into the coastal subgroup trapezountiac around trebizond ancient greek trapezous and the inland subgroup chaldiot in chaldia around argyroupolis gümüşhane and kanin in pontic its vicinity kelkit baibourt etc and around kotyora ordu speakers of chaldiot were the most numerous in phonology some varieties of pontic are

of the trapezountiac subgroup is called ophitic by linguists but speakers generally call it romeyka as few as people are reported to speak it there are however estimates that show the real number of

was spoken in a wider area stretching further east to the port town of athina pazar ophitic has retained the infinitive which is present in ancient greek but has been lost in other variants of modern greek it has therefore been characterized as archaic or conservative even in relation to other pontic dialects and as the living language that is closest to ancient greek a very similar dialect is

arvanites a population group in greece arvanitika is today endangered as its speakers have been shifting to the use of greek and most younger members of the community no longer speak it name the name arvanítika and its native equivalent arbërisht are derived from the ethnonym arvanites which in turn comes from the toponym arbëna greek άρβανα which in the middle ages referred to a region in what is today albania its native equivalents arbërorë arbëreshë and others used to be the self designation of albanians in general in the past arvanitika had sometimes been described as graeco albanian and the like e g furikis although today many arvanites consider such names offensive they generally identify nationally and ethnically as greeks and not albanians classification arvanitika was brought to southern greece during the late middle ages by settlers from what is today albania arvanitika is also closely related to arbëresh the dialect of albanian in italy which largely goes back to arvanite settlers from greece italian arbëresh has retained some words borrowed from greek for instance haristis thank you from ευχαριστώ dhrom road from δρόμος ne yes from ναι in certain villages italo arbëresh and graeco arvanitika have a mutually intelligible vocabulary base the unintelligible elements of the two dialects stem from the usage of italian or greek modernisms in the absence of native ones while linguistic scholarship unanimously describes arvanitika as a dialect of albanian many arvanites are reported to dislike the use of the name albanian to designate it as it carries the connotation of albanian nationality and is thus felt to call their greek identity into question sociolinguistic work has described arvanitika within the conceptual framework of ausbausprachen and abstandssprachen in terms of abstand objective difference of the linguistic systems linguists assessment of the degree of mutual intelligibility between arvanitika and standard tosk range from fairly high to only partial ethnologue the ethnologue also mentions that mutual intelligibility may even be problematic between different subdialects within arvanitika mutual intelligibility between standard tosk and arvanitika is higher than that between the two main dialect groups within albanian tosk and gheg see below for a sample text in the three language forms trudgill sums up that l inguistically there is no doubt that arvanitika is a variety of albanian in terms of ausbau sociolinguistic upgrading towards an autonomous standard language the strongest indicator of autonomy is the existence of a separate writing system the greek based arvanitic alphabet a very similar system was formerly in use also by other tosk albanian speakers between the th and th century however this script is very rarely used in practice today as arvanitika is almost exclusively a spoken language confined to the private sphere there is also some disagreement amongst arvanites as with the aromanians as to whether the latin alphabet should be used to write their language spoken arvanitika is internally richly diversified into sub dialects and no further standardization towards a common spoken or written standard arvanitika has taken place at the same time arvanites do not use standard albanian as their standard language either as they are generally not literate in the latin based standard albanian orthography and are not reported to use spoken language media in standard albanian in this sense then arvanitika is not functionally subordinated to standard albanian as a dachsprache roof language in the way dialects of a national language within the same country usually are geographic distribution there are three main groups of arvanitic settlements in greece most arvanites live in the south of greece across attica boeotia the peloponnese and some neighbouring areas and islands a second smaller group live in the northwest of greece in a zone contiguous with the albanian speaking lands proper a third outlying group is found in the northeast of greece in a few villages in thrace according to some authors the term arvanitika in its proper sense applies only to the southern group or to the southern and the thracian groups together i e to those dialects that have been separated from the core of albanian for several centuries the dialects in the northwest are reported to be more similar to neighbouring tosk dialects within albania and to the speech of the former muslim cham albanians çamërishte who used to live in the same region these dialects are classified by ethnologue as part of core tosk albanian as opposed to arvanitika albanian in the narrow sense although ethnologue notes that the term arvanitika is also often applied indiscriminately to both forms in greece in their own language some groups in the north west are reported to use the term shqip albanian language to refer to their own language as well as to that of albanian nationals and this has sometimes been interpreted as implying that they are ethnically albanians the arvanitika of southern greece is richly sub divided into local dialects sasse distinguishes as many as eleven dialect groups within that area west attic southeast attic northeast attic boeotian west boeotian central boeotian northeast peloponnesian northwest peloponnesian south peloponnesian west peloponnesian euboean and andriote estimated numbers of speakers of arvanitika vary widely between and these figures include terminal speakers tsitsipis of the younger generation who have only acquired an imperfect command of the language and are unlikely to pass it on to future generations the number of villages with traditional arvanite populations is estimated to more than there are no monolingual arvanitika speakers as all are today bilingual in greek arvanitika is considered an endangered language due to the large scale language shift towards greek among the descendants of arvanitika speakers in recent decades characteristics arvanitika shares many features with the tosk dialect spoken in southern albania however it has received a great deal of influence from greek mostly related to the vocabulary and the phonological system at the same time it is reported to have preserved some conservative features that were lost in mainstream albanian tosk for example it has preserved certain syllable initial consonant clusters which have been simplified in standard albanian cf arvanitika gljuhë ˈɡljuhə language tongue vs standard albanian gjuhë ˈɟuhə in recent times linguists have observed signs of accelerated structural convergence towards greek and structural simplification of the language which have been interpreted as signs of language attrition i e effects of impoverishment leading towards language death writing system arvanitika has rarely been written reportedly GHM it has been written in both the greek alphabet often with the addition of the letters b d e and j or diacritics e g and

2: instrumental magnitude refers to an uncalibrated apparent magnitude and like its counterpart it refers to the brightness of an astronomical object seen from an observer on earth but unlike its counterpart it is only useful in relative comparisons to other astronomical objects in the same image assuming the photometric calibration does not spatially vary across the image in the case of images from the palomar transient factory the absolute photometric calibration involves a zero point that varies over the image by up to magnitudes to make a required illumination correction instrumental magnitude is defined in various ways and so when working with instrumental magnitudes it is important to know how they are defined the most basic definition of instrumental magnitude m displaystyle m is given by m log f displaystyle m log f where f displaystyle f is the intensity of the source object in known physical units for example in the paper by mighell it was assumed that the data are in units of electron number generated within pixels of a charge coupled device the physical units of the source intensity are thus part of the definition required for any instrumental magnitudes that are employed the factor of in the above formula originates from the established fact that the human eye can only clearly distinguish the brightness of two objects if one is at least approximately times brighter than the other the instrumental magnitude is defined such that two objects with a brightness ratio of exactly will differ by precisely magnitudes and this is based on pogson s system of defining each successive magnitude as being fainter by displaystyle we can now relate this to the base logarithmic function and the leading coefficient in the above formula displaystyle cdots the approximate value of is used as a convenience its negative sign assures that brighter objects will have smaller and possibly negative values and tabulated values of base logarithms were available more than three centuries before the advent of computers and calculators references\n","cluster 2: FRB j less formally FRB is a repeating fast radio burst FRB discovered in by astronomers at the canadian hydrogen intensity mapping experiment CHIME telescope according to a study published in the january issue of the journal nature CHIME astronomers in cooperation with the radio telescopes at european VLBI network VLBI and the optical telescope gemini north on mauna kea hawaii were able to pinpoint the source of FRB to a location within a milky way like galaxy named SDSS j this places the source at redshift approximately million light years from the solar system significantly nearer than any other frbs localized to date and million years in the past during the ordovician period periodicity prior to the publication of the study in nature only two types of frbs had been observed non repeaters and repeaters non repeaters are one off frbs possibly associated with catastrophic stellar events in contrast repeaters are not one off but instead manifest recurring unpredictable sporadic and irregular radiation bursts their sources are less well understood FRB seems to represent a third and new type of FRB that may be termed periodic repeater the radiation activity of FRB repeats over a period of days broadly FRB emits a burst of radiation for approximately four days followed by an inactive period of about days then the cycle repeats additional follow up studies of the repeating FRB by the swift XRT and UVOT instruments were reported on february by the sardinia radio telescope SRT and medicina northern cross radio telescope MNC on february and by the galileo telescope in asiago also on february further observations were made by the chandra x ray observatory on and december with no significant x ray emissions detected at the FRB location or from the host galaxy SDSS j on april follow up studies by the global MASTER net were reported on the astronomer s telegram and on june further follow up studies were reported with the giant metrewave radio telescope ugmrt on june astronomers from jodrell bank observatory reported possible evidence that FRB exhibits the same radio burst behavior radio bursts observed in a window lasting approximately days followed by a silent period of days every days suggesting that the bursts may be associated with the orbital motion of a massive star a neutron star or a black hole this behavior is nearly times longer than the day periodicity exhibited by FRB in march another burst from the FRB was reported structure the day radiation burst is not homogeneous but is instead characterized by a pattern of sub bursts the pattern of radiation activity within the four day bursts is never exactly repeated however there is enough similarity i e alignment of the sub bursts from period to period to suggest that they form part of an original repeating pattern with internal structure of some complexity that has undergone distortion in the intervening million years and billion trillion kilometers approximately in march astronomers reported that the area producing pulses of FRB is about kilometre miles in scale based on studies at extremely short timescales references notes\n","cluster 2: a supernova plural supernovae or supernovas abbreviations SN and sne is a powerful and luminous stellar explosion this transient astronomical event occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star or when a white dwarf is triggered into runaway nuclear fusion the original object called the progenitor either collapses to a neutron star or black hole or is completely destroyed the peak optical luminosity of a supernova can be comparable to that of an entire galaxy before fading over several weeks or months supernovae are more energetic than novae in latin nova means new referring astronomically to what appears to be a temporary new bright star adding the prefix super distinguishes supernovae from ordinary novae which are far less luminous the word supernova was coined by walter baade and fritz zwicky in the most recent directly observed supernova in the milky way was kepler s supernova in but the remnants of more recent supernovae have been found observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur in the milky way on average about three times every century these supernovae would almost certainly be observable with modern astronomical telescopes the most recent naked eye supernova was SN a the explosion of a blue supergiant star in the large magellanic cloud a satellite of the milky way theoretical studies indicate that most supernovae are triggered by one of two basic mechanisms the sudden re ignition of nuclear fusion in a degenerate star such as a white dwarf or the sudden gravitational collapse of a massive star s core in the first class of events the object s temperature is raised enough to trigger runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting the star possible causes are an accumulation of material from a binary companion through accretion or a stellar merger in the massive star case the core of a massive star may undergo sudden collapse releasing gravitational potential energy as a supernova while some observed supernovae are more complex than these two simplified theories the astrophysical mechanics are established and accepted by the astronomical community supernovae can expel several solar masses of material at speeds up to several percent of the speed of light this drives an expanding shock wave into the surrounding interstellar medium sweeping up an expanding shell of gas and dust observed as a supernova remnant supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen to rubidium the expanding shock waves of supernovae can trigger the formation of new stars supernova remnants might be a major source of cosmic rays supernovae might produce gravitational waves though thus far gravitational waves have been detected only from the mergers of black holes and neutron stars observation history compared to a star s entire history the visual appearance of a supernova is very brief perhaps spanning several months so that the chances of observing one with the naked eye is roughly once in a lifetime only a tiny fraction of the billion stars in a typical galaxy have the capacity to become a supernova restricted to either those having large mass or extraordinarily rare kinds of binary stars containing white dwarfs the earliest possible recorded supernova known as HB could have been viewed and recorded by unknown indian observers in BC later SN was viewed by chinese astronomers in AD the brightest recorded supernova was SN which occurred in AD in the constellation of lupus and was described by observers across china japan iraq egypt and europe the widely observed supernova SN produced the crab nebula supernovae SN and SN the latest to be observed with the naked eye in the milky way galaxy had notable effects on the development of astronomy in europe because they were used to argue against the aristotelian idea that the universe beyond the moon and planets was static and unchanging johannes kepler began observing SN at its peak on october and continued to make estimates of its brightness until it faded from naked eye view a year later it was the second supernova to be observed in a generation after SN seen by tycho brahe in cassiopeia there is some evidence that the youngest galactic supernova g occurred in the late th century considerably more recently than cassiopeia a from around neither supernova was noted at the time in the case of g high extinction along the plane of the galaxy could have dimmed the event sufficiently to go unnoticed the situation for cassiopeia a is less clear infrared light echos have been detected showing that it was a type iib supernova and was not in a region of especially high extinction observation and discovery of extragalactic supernovae are now far more common the first such observation was of SN a in the andromeda galaxy today amateur and professional astronomers are finding several hundred every year some when near maximum brightness others on old astronomical photographs or plates american astronomers rudolph minkowski and fritz zwicky developed the modern supernova classification scheme beginning in during the s astronomers found that the maximum intensities of supernovae could be used as standard candles hence indicators of astronomical distances some of the most distant supernovae observed in appeared dimmer than expected this supports the view that the expansion of the universe is accelerating techniques were developed for reconstructing supernovae events that have no written records of being observed the date of the cassiopeia a supernova event was determined from light echoes off nebulae while the age of supernova remnant RX j was estimated from temperature measurements and the gamma ray emissions from the radioactive decay of titanium the most luminous supernova ever recorded is ASASSN lh at a distance of gigalight years it was first detected in june and peaked at billion l which is twice the bolometric luminosity of any other known supernova however the nature of this supernova continues to be debated and several alternative explanations have been suggested e g tidal disruption of a star by a black hole among the earliest detected since time of detonation and for which the earliest spectra have been obtained beginning at hours after the actual explosion is the type II SN fs iptf dqy which was recorded hours after the supernova event on october by the intermediate palomar transient factory iptf the star is located in a spiral galaxy named NGC million light years away in the constellation of pegasus on september amateur astronomer victor buso from rosario argentina was testing his telescope when taking several photographs of galaxy NGC buso chanced upon a supernova that had just become visible on earth after examining the images he contacted the instituto de astrofísica de la plata it was the first time anyone had ever captured the initial moments of the shock breakout from an optical supernova one not associated with a gamma ray or x ray burst the odds of capturing such an event were put between one in ten million to one in a hundred million according to astronomer melina bersten from the instituto de astrofísica the supernova buso observed was a type iib made by a star twenty times the mass of the sun astronomer alex filippenko from the university of california remarked that professional astronomers had been searching for such an event for a long time he stated observations of stars in the first moments they begin exploding provide information that cannot be directly obtained in any other way discovery early work on what was originally believed to be simply a new category of novae was performed during the s these were variously called upper class novae hauptnovae or giant novae the name supernovae is thought to have been coined by walter baade and fritz zwicky in lectures at caltech during it was used as super novae in a journal paper published by knut lundmark in and in a paper by baade and zwicky by the hyphen had been lost and the modern name was in use because supernovae are relatively rare events within a galaxy occurring about three times a century in the milky way obtaining a good sample of supernovae to study requires regular monitoring of many galaxies supernovae in other galaxies cannot be predicted with any meaningful accuracy normally when they are discovered they are already in progress to use supernovae as standard candles for measuring distance observation of their peak luminosity is required it is therefore important to discover them well before they reach their maximum amateur astronomers who greatly outnumber professional astronomers have played an important role in finding supernovae typically by looking at some of the closer galaxies through an optical telescope and comparing them to earlier photographs toward the end of the th century astronomers increasingly turned to computer controlled telescopes and ccds for hunting supernovae while such systems are popular with amateurs there are also professional installations such as the katzman automatic imaging telescope the supernova early warning system SNEWS project uses a network of neutrino detectors to give early warning of a supernova in the milky way galaxy neutrinos are particles that are produced in great quantities by a supernova and they are not significantly absorbed by the interstellar gas and dust of the galactic disk supernova searches fall into two classes those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away because of the expansion of the universe the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its doppler shift or redshift on average more distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby and so have a higher redshift thus the search is split between high redshift and low redshift with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum s frequency shift high redshift searches for supernovae usually involve the observation of supernova light curves these are useful for standard or calibrated candles to generate hubble diagrams and make cosmological predictions supernova spectroscopy used to study the physics and environments of supernovae is more practical at low than at high redshift low redshift observations also anchor the low distance end of the hubble curve which is a plot of distance versus redshift for visible galaxies naming convention supernova discoveries are reported to the international astronomical union s central bureau for astronomical telegrams which sends out a circular with the name it assigns to that supernova the name is formed from the prefix SN followed by the year of discovery suffixed with a one or two letter designation the first supernovae of the year are designated with a capital letter from a to z afterward pairs of lower case letters are used aa ab and so on hence for example SN c designates the third supernova reported in the year the last supernova of SN nc was the th the suffix nc acts as a bijective base encoding with a b c z since professional and amateur astronomers have been finding several hundreds of supernovae each year in in in in historical supernovae are known simply by the year they occurred SN SN SN SN called tycho s nova and SN kepler s star since the additional letter notation has been used even if there was only one supernova discovered that year e g SN a SN a etc this last happened with SN a SN for supernova is a standard prefix until two letter designations were rarely needed since however they have been needed every year since the increasing number of discoveries has regularly led to the additional use of three digit designations classification astronomers classify supernovae according to their light curves and the absorption lines of different chemical elements that appear in their spectra if a supernova s spectrum contains lines of hydrogen known as the balmer series in the visual portion of the spectrum it is classified type II otherwise it is type i in each of these two types there are subdivisions according to the presence of lines from other elements or the shape of the light curve a graph of the supernova s apparent magnitude as a function of time type i type i supernovae are subdivided on the basis of their spectra with type ia showing a strong ionised silicon absorption line type i supernovae without this strong line are classified as type ib and ic with type ib showing strong neutral helium lines and type ic lacking them the light curves are all similar although type ia are generally brighter at peak luminosity but the light curve is not important for classification of type i supernovae a small number of type ia supernovae exhibit unusual features such as non standard luminosity or broadened light curves and these are typically classified by referring to the earliest example showing similar features for example the sub luminous SN ha is often referred to as SN cx like or class ia cx a small proportion of type ic supernovae show highly broadened and blended emission lines which are taken to indicate very high expansion velocities for the ejecta these have been classified as type ic BL or ic bl type II the supernovae of type II can also be sub divided based on their spectra while most type II supernovae show very broad emission lines which indicate expansion velocities of many thousands of kilometres per second some such as SN gl have relatively narrow features in their spectra these are called type iin where the n stands for narrow a few supernovae such as SN k and SN j appear to change types they show lines of hydrogen at early times but over a period of weeks to months become dominated by lines of helium the term type iib is used to describe the combination of features normally associated with types II and ib type II supernovae with normal spectra dominated by broad hydrogen lines that remain for the life of the decline are classified on the basis of their light curves the most common type shows a distinctive plateau in the light curve shortly after peak brightness where the visual luminosity stays relatively constant for several months before the decline resumes these are called type II p referring to the plateau less common are type II l supernovae that lack a distinct plateau the l signifies linear although the light curve is not actually a straight line supernovae that do not fit into the normal classifications are designated peculiar or pec types III IV and v fritz zwicky defined additional supernovae types based on a very few examples that did not cleanly fit the parameters for type i or type II supernovae SN i in NGC was the prototype and only member of the type III supernova class noted for its broad light curve maximum and broad hydrogen balmer lines that were slow to develop in the spectrum SN f in NGC was the prototype and only member of the type IV class with a light curve similar to a type II p supernova with hydrogen absorption lines but weak hydrogen emission lines the type v class was coined for SN v in NGC an unusual faint supernova or supernova impostor with a slow rise to brightness a maximum lasting many months and an unusual emission spectrum the similarity of SN v to the eta carinae great outburst was noted supernovae in m and m and were also suggested as possible type IV or type v supernovae these types would now all be treated as peculiar type II supernovae iipec of which many more examples have been discovered although it is still debated whether SN v was a true supernova following an LBV outburst or an impostor current models supernovae type codes as described above are taxonomic the type number describes the light observed from the supernova not necessarily its cause for example type ia supernovae are produced by runaway fusion ignited on degenerate white dwarf progenitors while the spectrally similar type ib c are produced from massive wolf rayet progenitors by core collapse the following summarises what is currently believed to be the most plausible explanations for supernovae thermal runaway a white dwarf star may accumulate sufficient material from a stellar companion to raise its core temperature enough to ignite carbon fusion at which point it undergoes runaway nuclear fusion completely disrupting it there are three avenues by which this detonation is theorised to happen stable accretion of material from a companion the collision of two white dwarfs or accretion that causes ignition in a shell that then ignites the core the dominant mechanism by which type ia supernovae are produced remains unclear despite this uncertainty in how type ia supernovae are produced type ia supernovae have very uniform properties and are useful standard candles over intergalactic distances some calibrations are required to compensate for the gradual change in properties or different frequencies of abnormal luminosity supernovae at high redshift and for small variations in brightness identified by light curve shape or spectrum normal type ia there are several means by which a supernova of this type can form but they share a common underlying mechanism if a carbon oxygen white dwarf accreted enough matter to reach the chandrasekhar limit of about solar masses m for a non rotating star it would no longer be able to support the bulk of its mass through electron degeneracy pressure and would begin to collapse however the current view is that this limit is not normally attained increasing temperature and density inside the core ignite carbon fusion as the star approaches the limit to within about before collapse is initiated for a core primarily composed of oxygen neon and magnesium the collapsing white dwarf will typically form a neutron star in this case only a fraction of the star s mass will be ejected during the collapse within a few seconds a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes nuclear fusion releasing enough energy j to unbind the star in a supernova an outwardly expanding shock wave is generated with matter reaching velocities on the order of km s or roughly of the speed of light there is also a significant increase in luminosity reaching an absolute magnitude of or billion times brighter than the sun with little variation the model for the formation of this category of supernova is a close binary star system the larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence and it expands to form a red giant the two stars now share a common envelope causing their mutual orbit to shrink the giant star then sheds most of its envelope losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion at this point it becomes a white dwarf star composed primarily of carbon and oxygen eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf causing the latter to increase in mass despite widespread acceptance of the basic model the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event are still unclear type ia supernovae follow a characteristic light curve the graph of luminosity as a function of time after the event this luminosity is generated by the radioactive decay of nickel through cobalt to iron the peak luminosity of the light curve is extremely consistent across normal type ia supernovae having a maximum absolute magnitude of about this is because type ia supernovae arise from a consistent type of progenitor star by gradual mass acquisition and explode when they acquire a consistent typical mass giving rise to very similar supernova conditions and behavior this allows them to be used as a secondary standard candle to measure the distance to their host galaxies non standard type ia another model for the formation of type ia supernovae involves the merger of two white dwarf stars with the combined mass momentarily exceeding the chandrasekhar limit there is much variation in this type of event and in many cases there may be no supernova at all in which case they will have a broader and less luminous light curve than the more normal SN type ia abnormally bright type ia supernovae occur when the white dwarf already has a mass higher than the chandrasekhar limit possibly enhanced further by asymmetry but the ejected material will have less than normal kinetic energy there is no formal sub classification for the non standard type ia supernovae it has been proposed that a group of sub luminous supernovae that occur when helium accretes onto a white dwarf should be classified as type iax this type of supernova may not always completely destroy the white dwarf progenitor and could leave behind a zombie star one specific type of non standard type ia supernova develops hydrogen and other emission lines and gives the appearance of mixture between a normal type ia and a type iin supernova examples are SN ic and SN gj these supernovae have been dubbed type ia iin type ian type iia and type iian core collapse very massive stars can undergo core collapse when nuclear fusion becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity passing this threshold is the cause of all types of supernova except type ia the collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little radiated energy core collapse can be caused by several different mechanisms electron capture exceeding the chandrasekhar limit pair instability or photodisintegration when a massive star develops an iron core larger than the chandrasekhar mass it will no longer be able to support itself by electron degeneracy pressure and will collapse further to a neutron star or black hole electron capture by magnesium in a degenerate o ne mg core causes gravitational collapse followed by explosive oxygen fusion with very similar results electron positron pair production in a large post helium burning core removes thermodynamic support and causes initial collapse followed by runaway fusion resulting in a pair instability supernova a sufficiently large and hot stellar core may generate gamma rays energetic enough to initiate photodisintegration directly which will cause a complete collapse of the core the table below lists the known reasons for core collapse in massive stars the types of stars in which they occur their associated supernova type and the remnant produced the metallicity is the proportion of elements other than hydrogen or helium as compared to the sun the initial mass is the mass of the star prior to the supernova event given in multiples of the sun s mass although the mass at the time of the supernova may be much lower type iin supernovae are not listed in the table they can be produced by various types of core collapse in different progenitor stars possibly even by type ia white dwarf ignitions although it seems that most will be from iron core collapse in luminous supergiants or hypergiants including lbvs the narrow spectral lines for which they are named occur because the supernova is expanding into a small dense cloud of circumstellar material it appears that a significant proportion of supposed type iin supernovae are supernova impostors massive eruptions of LBV like stars similar to the great eruption of eta carinae in these events material previously ejected from the star creates the narrow absorption lines and causes a shock wave through interaction with the newly ejected material when a stellar core is no longer supported against gravity it collapses in on itself with velocities reaching km s c resulting in a rapid increase in temperature and density what follows next depends on the mass and structure of the collapsing core with low mass degenerate cores forming neutron stars higher mass degenerate cores mostly collapsing completely to black holes and non degenerate cores undergoing runaway fusion the initial collapse of degenerate cores is accelerated by beta decay photodisintegration and electron capture which causes a burst of electron neutrinos as the density increases neutrino emission is cut off as they become trapped in the core the inner core eventually reaches typically km in diameter and a density comparable to that of an atomic nucleus and neutron degeneracy pressure tries to halt the collapse if the core mass is more than about m then neutron degeneracy is insufficient to stop the collapse and a black hole forms directly with no supernova in lower mass cores the collapse is stopped and the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about billion kelvin times the temperature of the sun s core at this temperature neutrino antineutrino pairs of all flavours are efficiently formed by thermal emission these thermal neutrinos are several times more abundant than the electron capture neutrinos about joules approximately of the star s rest mass is converted into a ten second burst of neutrinos which is the main output of the event the suddenly halted core collapse rebounds and produces a shock wave that stalls within milliseconds in the outer core as energy is lost through the dissociation of heavy elements a process that is not clearly understood is necessary to allow the outer layers of the core to reabsorb around joules foe from the neutrino pulse producing the visible brightness although there are also other theories on how to power the explosion some material from the outer envelope falls back onto the neutron star and for cores beyond about m there is sufficient fallback to form a black hole this fallback will reduce the kinetic energy created and the mass of expelled radioactive material but in some situations it may also generate relativistic jets that result in a gamma ray burst or an exceptionally luminous supernova the collapse of a massive non degenerate core will ignite further fusion when the core collapse is initiated by pair instability oxygen fusion begins and the collapse may be halted for core masses of m the collapse halts and the star remains intact but collapse will occur again when a larger core has formed for cores of around m the fusion of oxygen and heavier elements is so energetic that the entire star is disrupted causing a supernova at the upper end of the mass range the supernova is unusually luminous and extremely long lived due to many solar masses of ejected ni for even larger core masses the core temperature becomes high enough to allow photodisintegration and the core collapses completely into a black hole type II stars with initial masses less than about m never develop a core large enough to collapse and they eventually lose their atmospheres to become white dwarfs stars with at least m possibly as much as m evolve in a complex fashion progressively burning heavier elements at hotter temperatures in their cores the star becomes layered like an onion with the burning of more easily fused elements occurring in larger shells although popularly described as an onion with an iron core the least massive supernova progenitors only have oxygen neon magnesium cores these super AGB stars may form the majority of core collapse supernovae although less luminous and so less commonly observed than those from more massive progenitors if core collapse occurs during a supergiant phase when the star still has a hydrogen envelope the result is a type II supernova the rate of mass loss for luminous stars depends on the metallicity and luminosity extremely luminous stars at near solar metallicity will lose all their hydrogen before they reach core collapse and so will not form a type II supernova at low metallicity all stars will reach core collapse with a hydrogen envelope but sufficiently massive stars collapse directly to a black hole without producing a visible supernova stars with an initial mass up to about times the sun or a little less at high metallicity result in a type II p supernova which is the most commonly observed type at moderate to high metallicity stars near the upper end of that mass range will have lost most of their hydrogen when core collapse occurs and the result will be a type II l supernova at very low metallicity stars of around m will reach core collapse by pair instability while they still have a hydrogen atmosphere and an oxygen core and the result will be a supernova with type II characteristics but a very large mass of ejected ni and high luminosity type ib and ic these supernovae like those of type II are massive stars that undergo core collapse however the stars which become types ib and ic supernovae have lost most of their outer hydrogen envelopes due to strong stellar winds or else from interaction with a companion these stars are known as wolf rayet stars and they occur at moderate to high metallicity where continuum driven winds cause sufficiently high mass loss rates observations of type ib c supernova do not match the observed or expected occurrence of wolf rayet stars and alternate explanations for this type of core collapse supernova involve stars stripped of their hydrogen by binary interactions binary models provide a better match for the observed supernovae with the proviso that no suitable binary helium stars have ever been observed since a supernova can occur whenever the mass of the star at the time of core collapse is low enough not to cause complete fallback to a black hole any massive star may result in a supernova if it loses enough mass before core collapse occurs type ib supernovae are the more common and result from wolf rayet stars of type WC which still have helium in their atmospheres for a narrow range of masses stars evolve further before reaching core collapse to become WO stars with very little helium remaining and these are the progenitors of type ic supernovae a few percent of the type ic supernovae are associated with gamma ray bursts GRB though it is also believed that any hydrogen stripped type ib or ic supernova could produce a GRB depending on the circumstances of the geometry the mechanism for producing this type of GRB is the jets produced by the magnetic field of the rapidly spinning magnetar formed at the collapsing core of the star the jets would also transfer energy into the expanding outer shell producing a super luminous supernova ultra stripped supernovae occur when the exploding star has been stripped almost all the way to the metal core via mass transfer in a close binary as a result very little material is ejected from the exploding star c m in the most extreme cases ultra stripped supernovae can occur in naked metal cores barely above the chandrasekhar mass limit SN ek might be an observational example of an ultra stripped supernova giving rise to a relatively dim and fast decaying light curve the nature of ultra stripped supernovae can be both iron core collapse and electron capture supernovae depending on the mass of the collapsing core failed supernovae the core collapse of some massive stars may not result in a visible supernova the main model for this is a sufficiently massive core that the kinetic energy is insufficient to reverse the infall of the outer layers onto a black hole these events are difficult to detect but large surveys have detected possible candidates the red supergiant n BH in NGC underwent a modest outburst in march before fading from view only a faint infrared source remains at the star s location light curves a historic puzzle concerned the source of energy that can maintain the optical supernova glow for months although the energy that disrupts each type of supernovae is delivered promptly the light curves are dominated by subsequent radioactive heating of the rapidly expanding ejecta some have considered rotational energy from the central pulsar the ejecta gases would dim quickly without some energy input to keep it hot the intensely radioactive nature of the ejecta gases which is now known to be correct for most supernovae was first calculated on sound nucleosynthesis grounds in the late s it was not until SN a that direct observation of gamma ray lines unambiguously identified the major radioactive nuclei it is now known by direct observation that much of the light curve the graph of luminosity as a function of time after the occurrence of a type II supernova such as SN a is explained by those predicted radioactive decays although the luminous emission consists of optical photons it is the radioactive power absorbed by the ejected gases that keeps the remnant hot enough to radiate light the radioactive decay of ni through its daughters co to fe produces gamma ray photons primarily of kev and kev that are absorbed and dominate the heating and thus the luminosity of the ejecta at intermediate times several weeks to late times several months energy for the peak of the light curve of SN a was provided by the decay of ni to co half life days while energy for the later light curve in particular fit very closely with the day half life of co decaying to fe later measurements by space gamma ray telescopes of the small fraction of the co and co gamma rays that escaped the SN a remnant without absorption confirmed earlier predictions that those two radioactive nuclei were the power sources the visual light curves of the different supernova types all depend at late times on radioactive heating but they vary in shape and amplitude because of the underlying mechanisms the way that visible radiation is produced the epoch of its observation and the transparency of the ejected material the light curves can be significantly different at other wavelengths for example at ultraviolet wavelengths there is an early extremely luminous peak lasting only a few hours corresponding to the breakout of the shock launched by the initial event but that breakout is hardly detectable optically the light curves for type ia are mostly very uniform with a consistent maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity their optical energy output is driven by radioactive decay of ejected nickel half life days which then decays to radioactive cobalt half life days these radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to incandescence studies of cosmology today rely on ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of type ia which are the standard candles of cosmology but whose diagnostic kev and kev gamma rays were first detected only in the initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted the light curve continues to decline in the b band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about days but this is only a hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it the visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt which has the longer half life and controls the later curve because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation after several months the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt although this portion of the light curve has been little studied type ib and ic light curves are basically similar to type ia although with a lower average peak luminosity the visual light output is again due to radioactive decay being converted into visual radiation but there is a much lower mass of the created nickel the peak luminosity varies considerably and there are even occasional type ib c supernovae orders of magnitude more and less luminous than the norm the most luminous type ic supernovae are referred to as hypernovae and tend to have broadened light curves in addition to the increased peak luminosity the source of the extra energy is thought to be relativistic jets driven by the formation of a rotating black hole which also produce gamma ray bursts the light curves for type II supernovae are characterised by a much slower decline than type i on the order of magnitudes per day excluding the plateau phase the visual light output is dominated by kinetic energy rather than radioactive decay for several months due primarily to the existence of hydrogen in the ejecta from the atmosphere of the supergiant progenitor star in the initial destruction this hydrogen becomes heated and ionised the majority of type II supernovae show a prolonged plateau in their light curves as this hydrogen recombines emitting visible light and becoming more transparent this is then followed by a declining light curve driven by radioactive decay although slower than in type i supernovae due to the efficiency of conversion into light by all the hydrogen in type II l the plateau is absent because the progenitor had relatively little hydrogen left in its atmosphere sufficient to appear in the spectrum but insufficient to produce a noticeable plateau in the light output in type iib supernovae the hydrogen atmosphere of the progenitor is so depleted thought to be due to tidal stripping by a companion star that the light curve is closer to a type i supernova and the hydrogen even disappears from the spectrum after several weeks type iin supernovae are characterised by additional narrow spectral lines produced in a dense shell of circumstellar material their light curves are generally very broad and extended occasionally also extremely luminous and referred to as a superluminous supernova these light curves are produced by the highly efficient conversion of kinetic energy of the ejecta into electromagnetic radiation by interaction with the dense shell of material this only occurs when the material is sufficiently dense and compact indicating that it has been produced by the progenitor star itself only shortly before the supernova occurs large numbers of supernovae have been catalogued and classified to provide distance candles and test models average characteristics vary somewhat with distance and type of host galaxy but can broadly be specified for each supernova type notes asymmetry a long standing puzzle surrounding type II supernovae is why the remaining compact object receives a large velocity away from the epicentre pulsars and thus neutron stars are observed to have high velocities and black holes presumably do as well although they are far harder to observe in isolation the initial impetus can be substantial propelling an object of more than a solar mass at a velocity of km s or greater this indicates an expansion asymmetry but the mechanism by which momentum is transferred to the compact object remains a puzzle proposed explanations for this kick include convection in the collapsing star and jet production during neutron star formation one possible explanation for this asymmetry is large scale convection above the core the convection can create variations in the local abundances of elements resulting in uneven nuclear burning during the collapse bounce and resulting expansion another possible explanation is that accretion of gas onto the central neutron star can create a disk that drives highly directional jets propelling matter at a high velocity out of the star and driving transverse shocks that completely disrupt the star these jets might play a crucial role in the resulting supernova a similar model is now favored for explaining long gamma ray bursts initial asymmetries have also been confirmed in type ia supernovae through observation this result may mean that the initial luminosity of this type of supernova depends on the viewing angle however the expansion becomes more symmetrical with the passage of time early asymmetries are detectable by measuring the polarization of the emitted light energy output although supernovae are primarily known as luminous events the electromagnetic radiation they release is almost a minor side effect particularly in the case of core collapse supernovae the emitted electromagnetic radiation is a tiny fraction of the total energy released during the event there is a fundamental difference between the balance of energy production in the different types of supernova in type ia white dwarf detonations most of the energy is directed into heavy element synthesis and the kinetic energy of the ejecta in core collapse supernovae the vast majority of the energy is directed into neutrino emission and while some of this apparently powers the observed destruction of the neutrinos escape the star in the first few minutes following the start of the collapse type ia supernovae derive their energy from a runaway nuclear fusion of a carbon oxygen white dwarf the details of the energetics are still not fully understood but the end result is the ejection of the entire mass of the original star at high kinetic energy around half a solar mass of that mass is ni generated from silicon burning ni is radioactive and decays into co by beta plus decay with a half life of six days and gamma rays co itself decays by the beta plus positron path with a half life of days into stable fe these two processes are responsible for the electromagnetic radiation from type ia supernovae in combination with the changing transparency of the ejected material they produce the rapidly declining light curve core collapse supernovae are on average visually fainter than type ia supernovae but the total energy released is far higher in these type of supernovae the gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy that compresses and collapses the core initially producing electron neutrinos from disintegrating nucleons followed by all flavours of thermal neutrinos from the super heated neutron star core around of these neutrinos are thought to deposit sufficient energy into the outer layers of the star to drive the resulting catastrophe but again the details cannot be reproduced exactly in current models kinetic energies and nickel yields are somewhat lower than type ia supernovae hence the lower peak visual luminosity of type II supernovae but energy from the de ionisation of the many solar masses of remaining hydrogen can contribute to a much slower decline in luminosity and produce the plateau phase seen in the majority of core collapse supernovae in some core collapse supernovae fallback onto a black hole drives relativistic jets which may produce a brief energetic and directional burst of gamma rays and also transfers substantial further energy into the ejected material this is one scenario for producing high luminosity supernovae and is thought to be the cause of type ic hypernovae and long duration gamma ray bursts if the relativistic jets are too brief and fail to penetrate the stellar envelope then a low luminosity gamma ray burst may be produced and the supernova may be sub luminous when a supernova occurs inside a small dense cloud of circumstellar material it will produce a shock wave that can efficiently convert a high fraction of the kinetic energy into electromagnetic radiation even though the initial energy was entirely normal the resulting supernova will have high luminosity and extended duration since it does not rely on exponential radioactive decay this type of event may cause type iin hypernovae although pair instability supernovae are core collapse supernovae with spectra and light curves similar to type II p the nature after core collapse is more like that of a giant type ia with runaway fusion of carbon oxygen and silicon the total energy released by the highest mass events is comparable to other core collapse supernovae but neutrino production is thought to be very low hence the kinetic and electromagnetic energy released is very high the cores of these stars are much larger than any white dwarf and the amount of radioactive nickel and other heavy elements ejected from their cores can be orders of magnitude higher with consequently high visual luminosity progenitor the supernova classification type is closely tied to the type of star at the time of the collapse the occurrence of each type of supernova depends dramatically on the metallicity and hence the age of the host galaxy type ia supernovae are produced from white dwarf stars in binary systems and occur in all galaxy types core collapse supernovae are only found in galaxies undergoing current or very recent star formation since they result from short lived massive stars they are most commonly found in type sc spirals but also in the arms of other spiral galaxies and in irregular galaxies especially starburst galaxies type ib c and II l and possibly most type iin supernovae are only thought to be produced from stars having near solar metallicity levels that result in high mass loss from massive stars hence they are less common in older more distant galaxies the table shows the progenitor for the main types of core collapse supernova and the approximate proportions that have been observed in the local neighbourhood there are a number of difficulties reconciling modelled and observed stellar evolution leading up to core collapse supernovae red supergiants are the progenitors for the vast majority of core collapse supernovae and these have been observed but only at relatively low masses and luminosities below about m and l respectively most progenitors of type II supernovae are not detected and must be considerably fainter and presumably less massive it is now proposed that higher mass red supergiants do not explode as supernovae but instead evolve back towards hotter temperatures several progenitors of type iib supernovae have been confirmed and these were k and g supergiants plus one a supergiant yellow hypergiants or lbvs are proposed progenitors for type iib supernovae and almost all type iib supernovae near enough to observe have shown such progenitors until just a few decades ago hot supergiants were not considered likely to explode but observations have shown otherwise blue supergiants form an unexpectedly high proportion of confirmed supernova progenitors partly due to their high luminosity and easy detection while not a single wolf rayet progenitor has yet been clearly identified models have had difficulty showing how blue supergiants lose enough mass to reach supernova without progressing to a different evolutionary stage one study has shown a possible route for low luminosity post red supergiant luminous blue variables to collapse most likely as a type iin supernova several examples of hot luminous progenitors of type iin supernovae have been detected SN gy and SN jl were both apparently massive luminous stars but are very distant and SN ip had a highly luminous progenitor likely to have been an LBV but is a peculiar supernova whose exact nature is disputed the progenitors of type ib c supernovae are not observed at all and constraints on their possible luminosity are often lower than those of known WC stars WO stars are extremely rare and visually relatively faint so it is difficult to say whether such progenitors are missing or just yet to be observed very luminous progenitors have not been securely identified despite numerous supernovae being observed near enough that such progenitors would have been clearly imaged population modelling shows that the observed type ib c supernovae could be reproduced by a mixture of single massive stars and stripped envelope stars from interacting binary systems the continued lack of unambiguous detection of progenitors for normal type ib and ic supernovae may be due to most massive stars collapsing directly to a black hole without a supernova outburst most of these supernovae are then produced from lower mass low luminosity helium stars in binary systems a small number would be from rapidly rotating massive stars likely corresponding to the highly energetic type ic BL events that are associated with long duration gamma ray bursts other impacts source of heavy elements supernovae are a major source of elements in the interstellar medium from oxygen through to rubidium though the theoretical abundances of the elements produced or seen in the spectra varies significantly depending on the various supernova types type ia supernovae produce mainly silicon and iron peak elements metals such as nickel and iron core collapse supernovae eject much smaller quantities of the iron peak elements than type ia supernovae but larger masses of light alpha elements such as oxygen and neon and elements heavier than zinc the latter is especially true with electron capture supernovae the bulk of the material ejected by type II supernovae is hydrogen and helium the heavy elements are produced by nuclear fusion for nuclei up to s silicon photodisintegration rearrangement and quasiequilibrium during silicon burning for nuclei between ar and ni and rapid capture of neutrons r process during the supernova s collapse for elements heavier than iron the r process produces highly unstable nuclei that are rich in neutrons and that rapidly beta decay into more stable forms in supernovae r process reactions are responsible for about half of all the isotopes of elements beyond iron although neutron star mergers may be the main astrophysical source for many of these elements in the modern universe old asymptotic giant branch AGB stars are the dominant source of dust from s process elements oxides and carbon however in the early universe before AGB stars formed supernovae may have been the main source of dust role in stellar evolution remnants of many supernovae consist of a compact object and a rapidly expanding shock wave of material this cloud of material sweeps up surrounding interstellar medium during a free expansion phase which can last for up to two centuries the wave then gradually undergoes a period of adiabatic expansion and will slowly cool and mix with the surrounding interstellar medium over a period of about years the big bang produced hydrogen helium and traces of lithium while all heavier elements are synthesised in stars and supernovae supernovae tend to enrich the surrounding interstellar medium with elements other than hydrogen and helium which usually astronomers refer to as metals these injected elements ultimately enrich the molecular clouds that are the sites of star formation thus each stellar generation has a slightly different composition going from an almost pure mixture of hydrogen and helium to a more metal rich composition supernovae are the dominant mechanism for distributing these heavier elements which are formed in a star during its period of nuclear fusion the different abundances of elements in the material that forms a star have important influences on the star s life and may decisively influence the possibility of having planets orbiting it the kinetic energy of an expanding supernova remnant can trigger star formation by compressing nearby dense molecular clouds in space the increase in turbulent pressure can also prevent star formation if the cloud is unable to lose the excess energy evidence from daughter products of short lived radioactive isotopes shows that a nearby supernova helped determine the composition of the solar system billion years ago and may even have triggered the formation of this system on june astronomers reported narrowing down the source of fast radio bursts frbs which may now plausibly include compact object mergers and magnetars arising from normal core collapse supernovae cosmic rays supernova remnants are thought to accelerate a large fraction of galactic primary cosmic rays but direct evidence for cosmic ray production has only been found in a small number of remnants gamma rays from pion decay have been detected from the supernova remnants IC and w these are produced when accelerated protons from the SNR impact on interstellar material gravitational waves supernovae are potentially strong galactic sources of gravitational waves but none have so far been detected the only gravitational wave events so far detected are from mergers of black holes and neutron stars probable remnants of supernovae effect on earth a near earth supernova is a supernova close enough to the earth to have noticeable effects on its biosphere depending upon the type and energy of the supernova it could be as far as light years away in it was theorised that traces of past supernovae might be detectable on earth in the form of metal isotope signatures in rock strata iron enrichment was later reported in deep sea rock of the pacific ocean in elevated levels of nitrate ions were found in antarctic ice which coincided with the and supernovae gamma rays from these supernovae could have boosted levels of nitrogen oxides which became trapped in the ice type ia supernovae are thought to be potentially the most dangerous if they occur close enough to the earth because these supernovae arise from dim common white dwarf stars in binary systems it is likely that a supernova that can affect the earth will occur unpredictably and in a star system that is not well studied the closest known candidate is IK pegasi see below recent estimates predict that a type II supernova would have to be closer than eight parsecs light years to destroy half of the earth s ozone layer and there are no such candidates closer than about light years milky way candidates the next supernova in the milky way will likely be detectable even if it occurs on the far side of the galaxy it is likely to be produced by the collapse of an unremarkable red supergiant and it is very probable that it will already have been catalogued in infrared surveys such as MASS there is a smaller chance that the next core collapse supernova will be produced by a different type of massive star such as a yellow hypergiant luminous blue variable or wolf rayet the chances of the next supernova being a type ia produced by a white dwarf are calculated to be about a third of those for a core collapse supernova again it should be observable wherever it occurs but it is less likely that the progenitor will ever have been observed it isn t even known exactly what a type ia progenitor system looks like and it is difficult to detect them beyond a few parsecs the total supernova rate in our galaxy is estimated to be between and per century although we haven t actually observed one for several centuries statistically the next supernova is likely to be produced from an otherwise unremarkable red supergiant but it is difficult to identify which of those supergiants are in the final stages of heavy element fusion in their cores and which have millions of years left the most massive red supergiants shed their atmospheres and evolve to wolf rayet stars before their cores collapse all wolf rayet stars end their lives from the wolf rayet phase within a million years or so but again it is difficult to identify those that are closest to core collapse one class that is expected to have no more than a few thousand years before exploding are the WO wolf rayet stars which are known to have exhausted their core helium only eight of them are known and only four of those are in the milky way a number of close or well known stars have been identified as possible core collapse supernova candidates the red supergiants antares and betelgeuse the yellow hypergiant rho cassiopeiae the luminous blue variable eta carinae that has already produced a supernova impostor and the brightest component a wolf rayet star in the regor or gamma velorum system others have gained notoriety as possible although not very likely progenitors for a gamma ray burst for example WR identification of candidates for a type ia supernova is much more speculative any binary with an accreting white dwarf might produce a supernova although the exact mechanism and timescale is still debated these systems are faint and difficult to identify but the novae and recurrent novae are such systems that conveniently advertise themselves one example is u scorpii the nearest known type ia supernova candidate is IK pegasi HR located at a distance of light years but observations suggest it will be several million years before the white dwarf can accrete the critical

SN cow ATLAS name ATLAS qqn also known as supernova cow AT cow AT astronomical transient and the cow was a very powerful astronomical explosion times brighter than a normal supernova spatially coincident with galaxy CGCG approximately million ly million pc distant in the hercules constellation it was first detected on june by the ATLAS HKO telescope and had generated significant interest among astronomers throughout the world later on july and after AT cow had significantly faded astronomers based on follow up studies with the nordic optical telescope NOT formally described AT cow as SN cow a type ib supernova showing an unprecedented spectrum for a supernova of this class although others mostly at first but also more recently have referred to it as a type ic BL supernova an explanation to help better understand the unique features of AT cow has been presented AT cow is one of the few reported fast blue optical transients fbots observed in the universe in may however a much more powerful FBOT than AT cow namely CRTS CSS j or CSS for short was reportedly observed on november two independent teams of astronomers both concluded that the AT cow event was either a newly formed black hole in the process of accreting matter or the frenetic rotation of a neutron star in january astronomers proposed that the explosion may have been a white dwarf being pulled apart by a black hole or a supernova leaving behind a black hole or a neutron star the creation of a compact body being observed for the first time history AT cow was first detected on june at UTC by the ATLAS HKO telescope a twin m in system at the haleakala observatory in hawaii it was a powerful astronomical explosion discovery magnitude redshift times brighter than a normal supernova spatially coincident with galaxy CGCG approximately million ly million pc distant in the hercules constellation by june this transient astronomical event had generated significant interest among astronomers throughout the world at least major telescopes were observing the event the largest number as of june of concurrent observations over posted on june of any astronomical event ever reported on the astronomer s telegram the event had been tentatively identified as a supernova and given the designation supernova cow and classification SN ic BL the first x ray and ultraviolet UV observations of AT cow were obtained on june with the swift telescope these observations revealed that the object was a bright x ray UV transient with an x ray luminosity of erg s and a UV brightness of about vega mag in the range å on june astronomers using the m in liverpool telescope and the m in telescope at palomar observatory noted on the astronomer s telegram AT cow has faded every night since our first observations june the reported observations suggest that although a link to ic BL sne and grbs remains credible given the smooth spectra and luminous radio and x ray counterpart s AT cow is distinct in other ways and its true identity remains unclear observations are continuing on june astronomers using m in telescopes at the beijing astronomical observatory reported further support for the fading of AT cow however using the swift XRT telescope on june an increase in the x ray luminosity of the transient was reported that would be the beginning of an unusual x ray variable behavior on july astronomers using the fermi large area telescope LAT reported that there were no significant mev gamma ray emissions between june further on july astronomers reported using the cadmium zinc telluride imager CZTI detector aboard the astrosat space observatory no hard x ray transients were detected between june event detection time and using the UVIT fitted with a f m filter observed an AB magnitude of an estimated at the AT cow location on july moreover astronomers on july reported using the MAXI GSC detector aboard the ISS that no significant x ray emissions were detected between june on july astronomers using nustar reported a lessening of hard x ray emissions from AT cow on july astronomers using integral reported no detections of the source from june july however GRB like bursts may have been observed earlier in the vicinity on and june although association of these bursts with AT cow may be disfavored radio emissions at ghz with a flux density of microjy were detected from the location of AT cow on july by e MERLIN radio emissions at the AT cow location were detected by ATCA at ghz with mjy flux density and at ghz with mjy on july and at ghz with mjy on july VLBI observations at ghz with the NRAO using the VLBA and effelsberg radio telescopes found a total flux density of mjy around july at a reportedly more accurate but consistent within uncertainties astrometric location of AT cow RA h m s DEC d than that of e MERLIN on july astronomers based on follow up studies with the m in nordic optical telescope NOT formally described AT cow as SN cow and as a type ib supernova showing an unprecedented spectrum for a supernova of this class on july astronomers using the m in kanata telescope at the higashi hiroshima observatory observed further declines in the optical and near infrared luminosity of the AT cow position in early july and noted that the large decline rates of the light curves were quite large compared to type ic ic BL and type ib c supernovae on august ultraviolet observations of the AT cow location using the wide field camera WFC on the hubble space telescope HST detected brightness vega mag of about on all four bands f w f w f w f w studied on august astronomers at the giant metrewave radio telescope GMRT detected a low frequency radio emission mhz band ujy at the AT cow position on august astronomers using the high energy stereoscopic system HESS array of cherenkov telescopes CTA reported no significant gamma ray source at the AT cow location on july which as a consequence resulted in the preliminary determination of upper limits on the integrated flux of the very high energy VHE gamma emission from AT cow as follows above the energy threshold gev sd an upper limit of e ph cm s above tev sd an upper limit of e ph cm s properties according to astronomers at the time of its discovery the explosion with a surface temperature of over c f k and traveling km s mi s may have been a cataclysmic variable star CV gamma ray burst GRB gravitational wave GW supernova SN or something else however the CV scenario was rapidly disfavored given the initial featureless optical spectrum and the large initial x ray luminosity of the transient according to astronomer kate maguire of queen s university belfast it really just appeared out of nowhere there are other objects that have been discovered that are as fast but the fastness and the brightness that s quite unusual the classification of type ic BL indicates a spectrum with very unusually broad lines but with no hydrogen lines and weak or missing helium lines such a spectrum is produced by the explosion of a very large star which has lost its outer layers of hydrogen and helium however according to astronomer shubham srivastav associated with the m in himalayan chandra telescope HCT although spectroscopic features indicate a tentative similarity with broad line ic supernovae its true nature remains a puzzle also according to maguire we re not sure yet what it is but the normal powering mechanism for a supernova is radioactive decay of nickel and this event is too bright and too fast for that the AT cow explosion could have been accompanied by a GW emission but the GW emission could not be detected since the LIGO detectors in the states of washington and louisiana were down at the time of the event due to service upgradings an explanation to help better understand the unique features of AT cow particularly as a white dwarf tidal disruption event has been presented as of september AT cow has been explained in various ways including as a type ic supernova a gamma ray burst an interaction between a white dwarf and black hole and as a magnetar preliminary studies to better understand the exact physical nature of AT cow using the european VLBI network EVN have been presented on november two independent teams of astronomers both concluded that the AT cow event was either a newly formed black hole in the process of accreting matter or the frenetic rotation of a neutron star in january anna ho of the california institute of technology in pasadena who conducted observations with the submillimeter array on mauna kea in hawaii noted that an unusually protracted period of continuing activity after the event was noticed enabled more extensive study than typically afforded during such events allowing observation of it while it was brightening subsequently astronomers proposed that AT cow may have been a white dwarf being pulled apart by a black hole or a supernova leaving behind a black hole or a neutron star the

detectable explosive event with an absolute magnitude m brighter than a classical nova m but fainter than that of a supernova m that nine magnitude range corresponds to a factor of nearly in luminosity so the ILOT class may include a wide variety of objects the term ILOT first appeared in a paper discussing the nova like event NGC OT as the term has gained more widespread use it has begun to be applied to some objects like kjpn and CK vulpeculae for which no transient event has been observed but which may have been dramatically affected by an ILOT event in the past the number of ilots known is expected to increase substantially when the vera c rubin observatory becomes operational a very wide variety of objects have been classified as ilots in the astronomical literature kashi and soker proposed a model for the outburt of ASASSN qi in which a jupiter mass planet is tidally destroyed and accreted onto a young main sequence star red novae believed be caused by the merger of two stars are classified as ilots some luminous blue variables such as η car have been classified as ilots some objects which have been classified as failed supernovae may be ilots the common thread tying all of these objects together is a transfer of a large amount of mass m to a few m from a planet or star to a companion star over a short period of time leading to a massive eruption that large range in accretion mass explains the large range in ILOT event brightness references external links the ILOT

to find terms that are semantically similar in some way. There are many approaches to finding semantically similar terms, including by using topic language models, pointwise mutual information, and word embedding. Among these, word embedding represents the current state-of-the-art in term clustering, and we will hence focus on word embedding for the remainder of this lab assignment.\n","\n","###Word Embedding\n","In ***word embedding***, each word is represented as a vector. Conceptually, this is very similar to representing documents as vectors in that each vector represents the word's location in a multidimensional space. Vector representations for each word are learned using a neural network, and the resulting vector locations have meaning relative to one another. Specifically, vectors of semantically similar words are closer to each other (in terms of cosine distance) than vectors for semantically dissimilar words. Google’s famous word embedding implementation is called **word2vec**, which we will be using in this assignment.\n","\n","Run the code cell below to download Google's pre-trained word2vec word embedding vectors and load those vectors into a word2vec object.
