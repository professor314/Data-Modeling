As such, we'll need to split each passage (paragraph) of text into sentences. **Don't be fooled into thinking that this is an easy task!** Accurately identifying the boundaries between sentences is a much subtler process than it may initially seem. At first, we may think that English has only three punctuation symbols that can end a sentence -- a period (full stop) `.`, an exclamation point `!`, and a question mark `?` -- and that we can therefore identify the end of a sentence just by looking for one of these symbols. Things are, however, not so simple. Consider the following sentences:\n","* I enjoy books written by George R. R. Martin.\n","* \"What time will you arrive?\", she asked.\n","\n","If we used our simple rules, then the first sentence above would be treated as three separate sentences:\n","1. I enjoy books written by George R.\n","2. R.\n","3. Martin.\n","\n","...and the second sentence above would be treated as two separate sentences:\n","1. \"What time will you arrive?\n","2. \", she asked.\n","\n","As you can see, this problem is not as easy as it seems! The task of identifying the boundaries between sentences is known as ***sentence boundary disambiguation***. If you'd like to learn more, then please read [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_boundary_disambiguation).\n","\n","The good news is that researchers have created sophisticated tools that can accurately identify sentence boundaries.

Sentences to N-Grams\n","Next, let's write a function that will convert a tokenized sentence into a list of n-grams of size `n`. Thus far in our course we've focused primarily on unigrams (1-grams), but these 1-grams do not encode any context because they are just single words. To add more context, we can consider short sequences of words. For example, with `n = 2`, we can capture more subtle concepts such as *bad movie* or *dark chocolate*. With `n = 3` we can capture even more subtle concepts such as *My favorite book* or *I like Python*. Using these short sequences of words, we will be able to calculate the probability of any word being the next word to appear in the sequence. For example, what word most likely comes next in this sequence?: *My favorite book ________*\n","\n","Run the code cell below to define a function that will convert a tokenized sentence into a list of n-grams of size `n`. Note that the function left-pads each sentence with an appropriate number of `<s>` start-of-sentence tags, depending on the value of `n`. This will allow us to figure out the probability of any word being the first word in a sentence. We also append an `</s>` end-of-sentence tag to the end of every sentence so that we will be able to identify n-grams that appear at the end of sentences. Note also that the n-grams are stored as tuples with the format: `((n - 1 previous words), next word in sequence)`. This format will be very useful when we begin calculating the probabailities of different words appearing next in a sequence."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Jn2ernJNJLQq","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1621217661304,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":343,"user":{"displayName":"Sean Connolly","photoUrl":"","userId":"15606364408941710004"}}},"source":["#define a function that will convert a tokenized sentence into a list of n-grams of size n.\n","def get_ngrams(sentence, n):\n","  #left-pad the sentence with an appropriate number of start-of-sentence tags.
